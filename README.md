About the Task
    In this real-world internship task, we will work with business sales data to perform the kind of analysis that data analysts do for real companies, startups, and agencies. 
    Our goal is not just to create charts, but to help a business answer important questions such as:
        Which products generate the most revenue?
        How do sales change over time?
        Which categories or regions are most profitable?
        Where should the business focus to grow faster?
    This task is designed so that even beginners can start, while still being valuable in real job and freelance scenarios.

    We just need curiosity, logical thinking, and willingness to learn analytics tools.
